    <string name="terminal_warning" tools:ignore="TypographyDashes">This terminal uses siac as its backend. Siac is a command-line utility written by the
        Sia developers that can interface with all of Sia\'s API endpoints; you can type --help and press enter for a list
        of commands. The purpose of this terminal and its use of siac is to make available to you commands that might not
        yet be part of the mobile graphical interface. While siac is fully functional on a computer, very little testing of
        it has been done on a mobile device. Functionality is not guaranteed. Use at your own risk.\n</string>

    <string name="step_5" tools:ignore="TypographyDashes"><![CDATA[5. In the same command prompt, type siad --disable-api-security --authenticate-api
    -a <ip>:<port>, replacing <ip> with your computer\'s internal IP address from step 4, and <port> with a port number
    of your choosing; remember your port number for later. This step will launch Sia on your computer in a fashion that
    allows Sia Mobile to interact with it. You will need to keep this command prompt open and running to use Sia Mobile with it.]]></string>

    <string name="step_8"><![CDATA[8. (optional) Following the steps above, you will only be able to access your
computer\'s Sia from your phone when your phone is on the same network as your computer. In order to access it from anywhere, you will have to port forward on your
router on your chosen port to your computer\'s internal IP address. Many guides exist online detailing how to do this.]]></string>
