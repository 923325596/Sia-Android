Sia Mobile serves as an Android client for the decentralized cloud storage platform [Sia](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia). Sia has the potential to disrupt the cloud storage industry, and a successful mobile app for Sia will greatly help in making this a reality. Sia Mobile aims to be that.

Sia Mobile can:
* Run a full Sia node on your device
* Interact with a full Sia node running on your computer
* Set up and maintain a local cold-storage wallet, as well as estimate its balance and transactions without a copy of the blockchain
* Generate a paper wallet
* Coming soon: upload to and download from the Sia cloud storage network (in-progress on the develop branch)
* Coming soon: SPV functionality (a.k.a. "lite wallet") once Sia implements this feature
